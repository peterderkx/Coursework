    "My dataset consists of lines with an average of about 5.5 words each. A good starting point for sequence_length might be around this average or slightly higher to capture the full context of each line and potentially a bit of the surrounding context. Considering the nature of typical language patterns, a sequence_length of around 10 to 15 words could be a reasonable choice. This allows each sequence to potentially encompass about two average-length lines, providing sufficient context in this setting where you have short dialogues between actors. \n",

    "The choice of batch size can depend on the memory capacity of training environment (like my GPU) and how quickly I want the training to proceed.\n",

    "I start with a batch_size of 64, which is often a good balance between training speed and memory usage, and then will try 128 in an attempt to lower my loss if needed, though it will slow down training process.\n",

    "The learning rate controls how much to update the model's weights with the gradient of the loss function. Typical values range from 0.001 to 0.01.
