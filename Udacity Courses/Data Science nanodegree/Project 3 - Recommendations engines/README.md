## Introduction
This project is an integral part of the Data Scientist Nanodegree Program offered by Udacity, developed in collaboration with IBM Watson Studio. IBM Watson Studio boasts a robust collaborative ecosystem featuring articles, datasets, notebooks, and a plethora of A.I. and ML resources. Users actively engage with these assets. To elevate the user experience and seamlessly connect them with these resources, we've developed a tailored recommendation system, ensuring a personalized journey for every user.

## File Descriptions

### Folder: data
- **articles_community.csv** - A CSV file encompassing all articles within the community, complete with metadata such as the document description, name, and more. <br/>
- **user-item-interactions.csv** - A CSV file detailing user-item interactions, where each row captures a specific interaction between a user and an associated article.<br/>

### in general folder
- **project_tests.py** - file used for evaluation purposes by udacity.<br/>
- **Recommendations_with_IBM.html** - an HTML file showcasing the executed notebook, produced post-program execution.<br/>
- **Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb** - the notebook detailing the sequential steps required to create a recommendation system.<br/>
- **top_10.p** - file used for evaluation purposes by udacity.<br/>
- **top_20.p** - file used for evaluation purposes by udacity.<br/>
- **top_5.p** - file used for evaluation purposes by udacity.<br/>
- **user_item_matrix.p** - file used for evaluation purposes by udacity.<br/>
- **user_recommendations.pkl** - a pkl file containing user recommendations, generated after executing the program.<br/>


## Installation
No additional libraries beyond those included in the Anaconda distribution should be necessary for installation. The code should run without any problems using Python 3.5 or later versions.

## Instructions
To get started, open the Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb notebook and execute all the cells sequentially.
